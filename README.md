Medicine Adherence Application 
===

We would like to create an APP for users which will serve as a medicine adherence module.
Many of the diseases require the patient to take medicines at a regular interval. Some of the diseases like BP, Diabetes, Tuberculosis have really strict norms about taking medicines. In case the medicine is not taken in time then the patientâ€™s health is impacted negatively. 

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code
* Node
* JDK
* Android development environment
* React Native CLI
    <br>You can refer this also for setting up environment : https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Installing app
Clone the repository and install dependencies on project folder using below commands:
```  
git clone https://github.com/nineleaps-training/MedStick_FE  

cd medicine_adherence_frontend

npm install  
```  
## `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.
Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:
```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

## `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). 
If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.
